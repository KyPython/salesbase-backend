üíª SalesBase Backend: An Enterprise-Grade CRM API
This repository contains the backend API for SalesBase, an enterprise-level Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. Built with Node.js and Express, this service is designed to be a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for managing all core CRM operations. It demonstrates a professional approach to API design, data management, and system architecture.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Technologies
The technology stack was chosen to deliver performance, security, and scalability required for enterprise applications.

Node.js & Express: Provides a high-performance, asynchronous server environment ideal for building RESTful APIs.

PostgreSQL: Serves as the primary relational database, chosen for its reliability, data integrity, and powerful query capabilities.

Redis: Utilized for caching, session management, and rate limiting to dramatically improve application performance and responsiveness.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Implements a secure, stateless authentication mechanism for API access.

Swagger: Provides a living, self-documented API reference, simplifying integration for developers and external services.

Docker: Enables containerized deployment for consistent and reproducible builds across development and production environments.

üöÄ Key Features & Professional Practices
This project showcases a range of professional backend development skills, focusing on security, maintainability, and enterprise readiness.

RESTful API: A well-defined and predictable set of endpoints for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality on core CRM resources.

Secure Authentication: Implements JWT-based authentication to protect all API routes.

Scalability & Performance: Leverages Redis for efficient caching and implements middleware for rate limiting and CORS to enhance security and prevent abuse.

Comprehensive Documentation: Provides interactive Swagger API documentation at /api/docs, ensuring ease of use for internal and third-party integrations.

Deployment-Ready: Includes a Dockerfile for seamless containerization and automated deployment pipelines.

Reliability: Implements a /api/health check endpoint for monitoring and a robust error-handling system.

Scheduled Tasks: Demonstrates the ability to run automated backups, data syncs, and other scheduled tasks.
